Racial Bias in Criminal Appeals</h3><p> with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/annaharvey/">Anna Harvey</a></p>
<p>	Existing work indicates that retention through reelection induces larger effects on judicial votes in criminal cases than retention through reappointment. 
	Yet existing work has addressed neither selection effects, nor heterogeneous treatment effects by defendant race, across retention institutions. 
	Leveraging the unique retention institutions governing New York State's intermediate appellate judges, we report the first within-justice estimates of 
	the effects of both reelection and reappointment incentives on judicial votes in criminal appeals. Our findings indicate that impending judicial 
	reappointment induces a 33 - 36\% decrease in appellate votes in favor of black defendants, but has no effects on votes in cases involving white 
	or non-Hispanic white defendants. We find no additional effects of impending reelection on appellate justice votes in criminal appeals. Our findings 
	may indicate the need for greater attention devoted both to potential selection effects, and to heterogeneous effects by defendant race, in studies of judicial retention institutions.</p>

A Silent Corrupting Force? Recall Elections and Criminal Sentencing</h3><p> with <a href="https://sanfordgordon.com/">Sandford Gordon</a></p>
<p>	Does the threat of recall effect the behavior of elected officials? In the United States, 39
	states authorize recall elections at some level for elected officials. Nonetheless, the electoral
	incentives of recall elections are not well-understood. We explore how changes in the threat of
	recall salience alter the sentencing behavior of judges. In 2016, national news coverage following
	the conviction and sentencing of Brock Turner, a Stanford athlete, for sexual assault sparked a
	petition drive to recall the sentencing judge, Aaron Persky. Critics of Persky, pointing to the
	apparent leniency of the prescribed sentence, accused the judge of bias in favor of an affluent
	white male defendant. The recall drive was ultimately successful, with Persky losing his seat by
	a wide margin in 2018. Using data on almost 20 thousand sentences from Superior Courts in six
	California counties, we examine whether critical points in the recall campaign were accompanied
	by corresponding changes in judicial punitiveness. Our analysis suggests a discontinuous increase
	in sentencing stringency associated with the initial petition announcement, but not with either
	the petition’s certification or the recall itself. We document heterogeneity in the magnitude of
	the effect across felony classes, but not defendant race. Our findings imply that judges updated
	their beliefs about the electoral consequences of their decisions in response to the possibility of
	a recall, and not the recall itself. They also point to the possibility that specific political actions
	may have unintended consequences reaching beyond their intended target/</p>

Bridging the Grade Gap: Reducing Assessment Bias in a Multi-Grader Class </h3><p> with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/seankates/">Sean Kates</a>,
<a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/tinenpaulsen/">Tine Paulsen</a> and <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/fas-joshuatucker/">Joshua Tucker</a></p>
<p> 	Many large survey courses rely on multiple professors or teaching assistants to judge student responses to open-ended questions. 
	Even following best practices, multiple graders can result in students with similar levels of conceptual understanding to receive 
	widely varying assessments. We detail how this can occur, and argue that it is an example of differential item functioning 
	(or interpersonal incomparability), where graders interpret the same possible grading range differently. Using both actual 
	assessment data from a large survey course in Comparative Politics and simulation methods, we show that the bias can be corrected 
	for by a small number of ``bridging'' observations across graders. We conclude by offering best practices for fair assessment in 
	large survey courses.

Democratic Reversals and the Size of Government</h3><p> with <a href="https://www.jeffreyljensen.com/">Jeff Jensen</a></p>
<em>European Journal of Political Economy (2019) </em></p> 
<p> 	While the fiscal and redistributive consequences of democracy is one of the central debates in political economy, most empirical 
	studies analyze this question solely in the context of transitions to democracy. In this paper, we explore the consequences to 
	taxation of democratic reversal using the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in the US South between 1880 and 1910. 
	Following the federally-imposed extension of the franchise to the former slaves during Reconstruction (1865–1877), Southern states 
	erected a series of legal restrictions, such as literacy tests and poll taxes, aimed primarily at preventing Southern African Americans 
	from registering to vote. Using an original dataset of local and state taxes and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we 
	demonstrate that the adoption of literacy tests for voting eligibility in each state was followed by a significant decline in tax 
	revenues that is highly correlated to the share of each county's population who was African American. We also find that black 
	disenfranchisement led to a shift of the tax burden onto urban counties and a greater reliance on indirect taxation. Our results 
	survive a battery of robustness checks, alternative specifications and additional tests of the redistributionist thesis. The findings 
	are not only consistent with standard models of redistribution following democratization, but also indicate that the elasticity of taxes 
	with respect to enfranchisement is substantial and larger than the one suggested by the cross-national literature.</p>

Minority Representation and Democratization by Force</h3><p> with <a href="http://www.mariochacon.com/">Mario Chacón</a> and <a href="https://www.jeffreyljensen.com/">Jeff Jensen</a></p>
<p>What determines the effective representation of previously disfranchised groups in new democracies? How important is the enforcement of their newly established political rights? We explore these questions using the extension of the franchise and the federal intervention in the American South following the Civil War. We explore how the military occupation during Reconstruction influenced the capacity of recently emancipated and enfranchised constituencies to elect African Americans as their representatives. Using an original dataset of state legislators we find that counties occupied by federal troops were significantly more likely to elect black representatives. To estimate causal effects, we leverage the interaction between national deployments and a cross-sectional measure of propensity for occupation as an instrument. The evidence suggests that troops interacted positively with factors associated with political mobilization such as the (prewar) incidence of free blacks, the density of black networks, the presence of the Freedmen’s Bureau field offices, and the early election of black delegates in the Reconstruction conventions. This suggests that de facto enforcement of newly established de jure rights is a key determinant of minority representation in new and conflict-prone democracies.</p>
