Judicial Accountability and Racial Disparity in Criminal Appeals</h3><p> with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/annaharvey/">Anna Harvey</a></p>
<em>Forthcoming, Journal of Legal Studies.</em></p> 
<p>	Existing work indicates that retention through election induces larger effects on judicial votes in criminal cases than retention 
	through appointment. Yet existing work has addressed neither case selection effects across retention institutions nor heterogeneous treatment 
	effects by defendant and judge race. Leveraging the unique retention institutions governing New York State's intermediate appellate judges, we 
	report the first within-justice estimates of the effects of reelection and reappointment incentives on judicial votes in criminal appeals. We 
	find that impending judicial reappointment induces a 49 - 52% within-justice decrease in pro-defendant votes in appeals involving Black defendants 
	heard by all-white panels but does not affect votes in other cases. We find no additional effect of impending reelection on appellate justice votes 
	in criminal appeals. Our findings suggest the need for greater attention devoted both to potential selection effects and to heterogeneous effects 
	by defendant and judge race in studies of judicial retention institutions.</p>

Incentive Effects of Recall Elections: Evidence from California Superior Court Judges</h3><p> with <a href="https://sanfordgordon.com/">Sanford Gordon</a></p>
<p>	39 U.S. states authorize recall elections, but the incentives they create are understudied. We examine how changes in the perceived 
	threat of recall alter behavior of one set of officials: judges. In 2016, outrage over the sentence imposed on a Stanford athlete following 
	his sexual assault conviction sparked a drive to recall the presiding judge. Using case disposition data from six California counties and 
	matched arrest records for a subset of defendants, we examine whether critical events in the recall campaign were accompanied by corresponding 
	changes in other judges' sentences. We find a large, discontinuous increase in severity associated with the campaign's announcement, but not 
	the recall itself -- suggesting the announcement shifted judges' beliefs about their political environment. The increase may have indirectly 
	burdened minority defendants disproportionately. Our findings are the first to document incentive effects of recall, and suggest that targeted 
	political campaigns may have far-reaching, unintended consequences.</p>

Bridging the Grade Gap: Reducing Assessment Bias in a Multi-Grader Class </h3><p> with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/seankates/">Sean Kates</a>,

<p> 	Many large survey courses rely on multiple professors or teaching assistants to judge student responses to open-ended questions. 
	Even following best practices, multiple graders can result in students with similar levels of conceptual understanding to receive 
	widely varying assessments. We detail how this can occur, and argue that it is an example of differential item functioning 
	(or interpersonal incomparability), where graders interpret the same possible grading range differently. Using both actual 
	assessment data from a large survey course in Comparative Politics and simulation methods, we show that the bias can be corrected 
	for by a small number of ``bridging'' observations across graders. We conclude by offering best practices for fair assessment in 
	large survey courses.

Democratic Reversals and the Size of Government</h3><p> with <a href="https://www.jeffreyljensen.com/">Jeff Jensen</a></p>
<em>European Journal of Political Economy (2019) </em></p> 
<p> 	While the fiscal and redistributive consequences of democracy is one of the central debates in political economy, most empirical 
	studies analyze this question solely in the context of transitions to democracy. In this paper, we explore the consequences to 
	taxation of democratic reversal using the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in the US South between 1880 and 1910. 
	Following the federally-imposed extension of the franchise to the former slaves during Reconstruction (1865–1877), Southern states 
	erected a series of legal restrictions, such as literacy tests and poll taxes, aimed primarily at preventing Southern African Americans 
	from registering to vote. Using an original dataset of local and state taxes and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we 
	demonstrate that the adoption of literacy tests for voting eligibility in each state was followed by a significant decline in tax 
	revenues that is highly correlated to the share of each county's population who was African American. We also find that black 
	disenfranchisement led to a shift of the tax burden onto urban counties and a greater reliance on indirect taxation. Our results 
	survive a battery of robustness checks, alternative specifications and additional tests of the redistributionist thesis. The findings 
	are not only consistent with standard models of redistribution following democratization, but also indicate that the elasticity of taxes 
	with respect to enfranchisement is substantial and larger than the one suggested by the cross-national literature.</p>

Minority Representation and Democratization by Force</h3><p> with <a href="http://www.mariochacon.com/">Mario Chacón</a> and <a href="https://www.jeffreyljensen.com/">Jeff Jensen</a></p>
<em></em></p> 
<p>What determines the effective representation of previously disfranchised groups in new democracies? How important is the enforcement of their newly established political rights? We explore these questions using the extension of the franchise and the federal intervention in the American South following the Civil War. We explore how the military occupation during Reconstruction influenced the capacity of recently emancipated and enfranchised constituencies to elect African Americans as their representatives. Using an original dataset of state legislators we find that counties occupied by federal troops were significantly more likely to elect black representatives. To estimate causal effects, we leverage the interaction between national deployments and a cross-sectional measure of propensity for occupation as an instrument. The evidence suggests that troops interacted positively with factors associated with political mobilization such as the (prewar) incidence of free blacks, the density of black networks, the presence of the Freedmen’s Bureau field offices, and the early election of black delegates in the Reconstruction conventions. This suggests that de facto enforcement of newly established de jure rights is a key determinant of minority representation in new and conflict-prone democracies.</p>
