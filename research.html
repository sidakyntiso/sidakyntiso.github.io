<p><em>European Journal of Political Economy (2019) </em></p> 
<div class="grid-65">
<p> 	While the fiscal and redistributive consequences of democracy is one of the central debates in political economy, most empirical 
	studies analyze this question solely in the context of transitions to democracy. In this paper, we explore the consequences to 
	taxation of democratic reversal using the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in the US South between 1880 and 1910. 
	Following the federally-imposed extension of the franchise to the former slaves during Reconstruction (1865â€“1877), Southern states 
	erected a series of legal restrictions, such as literacy tests and poll taxes, aimed primarily at preventing Southern African Americans 
	from registering to vote. Using an original dataset of local and state taxes and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we 
	demonstrate that the adoption of literacy tests for voting eligibility in each state was followed by a significant decline in tax 
	revenues that is highly correlated to the share of each county's population who was African American. We also find that black 
	disenfranchisement led to a shift of the tax burden onto urban counties and a greater reliance on indirect taxation. Our results 
	survive a battery of robustness checks, alternative specifications and additional tests of the redistributionist thesis. The findings 
	are not only consistent with standard models of redistribution following democratization, but also indicate that the elasticity of taxes 
	with respect to enfranchisement is substantial and larger than the one suggested by the cross-national literature.</p>

<p><a href="Papers/a-silent-corrupting-force.pdf">Incentive Effects of Recall Elections: Evidence from California Superior Court Judges</a> with <a href="https://sanfordgordon.com/">Sanford Gordon</a></p>
<p><em>Revise and Resubmit, Journal of Politics.</em></p> 
<div class="grid-65"></div><article class="paper"><div class="grid-35"><a class=whaddup href="Papers/a-silent-corrupting-force/"></a>

<p>	39 U.S. states authorize recall elections, but the incentives they create are understudied. We examine how changes in the perceived 
	threat of recall alter behavior of one set of officials: judges. In 2016, outrage over the sentence imposed on a Stanford athlete following 
	his sexual assault conviction sparked a drive to recall the presiding judge. Using case disposition data from six California counties and 
	matched arrest records for a subset of defendants, we examine whether critical events in the recall campaign were accompanied by corresponding 
	changes in other judges' sentences. We find a large, discontinuous increase in severity associated with the campaign's announcement, but not 
	the recall itself -- suggesting the announcement shifted judges' beliefs about their political environment. The increase may have indirectly 
	burdened minority defendants disproportionately. Our findings are the first to document incentive effects of recall, and suggest that targeted 
	political campaigns may have far-reaching, unintended consequences.</p>

<p><a href="Papers/bridgegradinggap.pdf">Bridging the Grade Gap: Reducing Assessment Bias in a Multi-Grader Class</a>  with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/seankates/">Sean Kates</a>,
<a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/tinenpaulsen/">Tine Paulsen</a> and <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/fas-joshuatucker/">Joshua Tucker</a></p>
<p><em>Revise & Resubmit, Political Analysis.</em></p> 
<p> 	Many large survey courses rely on multiple professors or teaching assistants to judge student responses to open-ended questions. 
	Even following best practices, multiple graders can result in students with similar levels of conceptual understanding to receive 
	widely varying assessments. We detail how this can occur, and argue that it is an example of differential item functioning 
	(or interpersonal incomparability), where graders interpret the same possible grading range differently. Using both actual 
	assessment data from a large survey course in Comparative Politics and simulation methods, we show that the bias can be corrected 
	for by a small number of ``bridging'' observations across graders. We conclude by offering best practices for fair assessment in 
	large survey courses.</p>
