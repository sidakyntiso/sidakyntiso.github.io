	<p class="coauthors"><a href="">A Silent Corrupting Force? Recall Elections and Criminal Sentencing</a> with <a href="https://sanfordgordon.com/">Sandford Gordon</a></p>
	<p>Does the threat of recall affect the sentencing behavior of judges? In 2016, outrage following the six month prison term assigned to Brock Turner, a Stanford athlete convicted for sexual assault, sparked a petition drive to recall the sentencing judge. Critics of Judge Aaron Persky pointed to the apparent leniency of the prescribed sentence, and accused him of bias in favor of an affluent white male defendant. Persky was ultimately recalled. Using data on almost twenty thousand sentences from Superior Courts in six California counties, we examine whether critical points in the recall campaign were accompanied by corresponding changes in judicial punitiveness. We find a large, discontinuous increase in sentencing stringency associated with the initial petition announcement, but not with the petition's certification or the recall itself. Increases in punishment were associated almost entirely with violent crimes, and were disproportionately borne by minority defendants. Our most conservative estimates sugge	st that in the 40 days following the announcement, almost 300 years of additional incarceration were handed down by judges in the six counties. Our findings imply that judges updated their beliefs about the electoral consequences of their decisions in response to the emergent threat of recall, and not the recall itself. They also suggest that punishing judges electorally for leniency may have unintended consequences reaching well beyond the intended targets.</p>
